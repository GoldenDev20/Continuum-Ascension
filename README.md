# Continuum Ascension  
*Forge the past, fracture the future, ascend the infinite.*

## Premise
Reality is a broken loop. Every choice splinters a new timeline; every timeline breeds new horrors.  
Armed with lost tech, arcane science and unstable magic, you must stabilise the Continuum—before the Ascension wars erase existence itself.

## Core Hooks
*   **Branching Progression** – quest gates unlock *per timeline*; skip or lock entire tech trees by decisions.  
*   **Fractured Dimensions** – custom world-gen layers: primordial wilds, industrial wastelands, crystallised futures.  
*   **Unstable Power** – high-tier gear randomly backfires unless stabilised with rare *Continuum Shards*.  
*   **Server-First Design** – background pre-generation, lag-reducing mods, 60 s cold-boot target.  
*   **Seamless Co-op** – FTB Teams, chunk claiming, economy & market built-in.
